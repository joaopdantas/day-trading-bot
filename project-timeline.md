## Progress Tracking Between Control Points

To ensure continuous progress between control points, we will:

1. Implement weekly internal checkpoints
2. Track task completion in Trello boards
3. Maintain a development log of key achievements and challenges
4. Update the GitHub repository with regular commits
5. Document any scope changes or technical decisions

This approach will ensure the project maintains momentum between formal control points and allows for timely adjustments if any issues arise.
