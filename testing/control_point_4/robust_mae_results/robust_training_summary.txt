ROBUST MAE REDUCTION - FIXED EARLY STOPPING
Date: 2025-05-27 16:07:51
Symbol: MSFT
Dataset: 684 data points

FIXES APPLIED:
1. Early Stopping: Patience = 50 epochs
2. Learning Rate: Custom schedule, less aggressive
3. Architecture: Batch norm + L2 regularization
4. Data: Better train/val split, more robust features
5. Loss: Huber loss (more stable than MAE)
